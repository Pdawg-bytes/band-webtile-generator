# band-webtile-generator
This is a UWP app that replaces the old website to make a Microsoft Band Web Tile. It's written with C#, XAML, and WinUI 2.8. It supports customization of a webtile, and also creating a new one. Not all webtiles can be fully automatic, and code may have to be written by you. It's super easy though!

# Building
To build this app, download the source code, open in in Visual Studio 2022 with UWP support. That's all! 

# Installing
Installing this app is quite simple. You need to first install the certificate in the zip folder to Local Machine > Trusted People. Now why do you need to do this, you may ask? Well that's because the UWP container needs the app to be launched by the shell correctly, and the certificate is a code signing measure. Anyway, after installing the certificate, double click the .APPX file, then click "Install". That should let you install and run the app! Enjoy!
